# Workshop Description

AI and ML systems designed and deployed to support decision making in the real world need to perform _complex reasoning under uncertainty_. For safety-critical systems, such as applications in healthcare and finance, it is crucial that this reasoning is *reliable*, i.e. either _exact_ or coming with approximation guarantees. At the same time, it is important that these guarantees can be carried out *efficiently*. For this, tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) are very appealing because they support reliable and efficient reasoning for a wide range of reasoning scenarios, by _design_. Therefore, it is no wonder that research on modeling and learning different TPMs has been flourishing recently. The variegated TPM spectrum includes models that deliver tractable computation of likelihoods such as **normalizing flow** and **autoregressive models**; tractable marginals, such as **mixture models**, **bounded-treewidth models**, and *determinantal point processes*; and models supporting more complex reasoning scenarios such as **probabilistic circuits**. As the subtitle of this yearâ€™s Workshop proposal suggests, we are particularly interested in bridging the latest theoretical advancements in this spectrum with the burgeoning literature on applying TPMs to real-world problems.  In particular, TPMs have been successfully used in image classification, completion and generation, activity recognition, language and speech modeling, verification and diagnosis of physical systems, and more recently in computational life science, e.g., for drug discovery and epidemiology modeling.
